## Weather Dashboard

The goal of this project was to build a weather dashboard with dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
  
The OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) was used to retrieve weather data for cities. 

### How It Works:

- When the user searches for a city in the search field current weather information for that city is displayed

- Current weather information provided to the user includes the city name, date, icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index

- The UV Index field is colored to show if the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

- When the user searches for a city they are also presented with a 5-day forecast for that city

- Information from the 5-day forecast includes the date, a weather condition icon, the temperature, and the humidity

- After the city is entered it is added to the search history

- When the user clicks on a city in the search history they are provided with current weather and a future forecast for that city

- When the weather dashboard is opened weather information for the last city searched is provided
